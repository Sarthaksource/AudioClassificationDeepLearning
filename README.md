# Audio Classifier

Used Deep Learning for this audio classifier.

First I implemented a simple CNN for audio classification. Then I used a pretrained model (EfficientNet) along with a custom classifier for audio classification which gave me an accuracy of 52.5%.

However this accuracy can be increased by using a different model alng with more layers in the NN, also we can apply some transformations to the audio dataset to generate more samples and hence increase the accuracy of the model.
